# dine-discover
 
As the creator of Dine-Discover, I have developed a comprehensive platform that empowers users to easily explore, review, and rate restaurants. Dine-Discover offers a seamless user experience, enabling diners to share their culinary experiences and discover new dining destinations based on authentic reviews and ratings from fellow food enthusiasts. This project showcases my Full Stack Web Development expertise, utilizing a tech stack that includes React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL and is hosted on Render for reliable performance and scalability.
